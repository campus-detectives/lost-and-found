# lost-and-found

Lost-and-found will be used to solve the hectic search of the lost item of the students.

The problem:
Currently the lost and found items are handed over to the nearest watchman.The person who lost the item isnt really aware where to find the lost item.The watchman in charge has to maintain a register of the lost items.

The person who lost the item has to go to every possible place he/she has been to look for the item.

The solution presented will make is this process easy and convient for the authorities as well the students(dayscollars/hostelars)

The solution:

Authority side:
The campus will be devided into areas and each area will have a lost and found hub.
When an item is found should be deposited at the hub.
The watchman/authority in charge will click a photo of the item and post it on the app along with the hub it is deposited to.
The app will use AI to identify the object and these information is stored in the data base untill someone claims the item.

Student side:
The student who has lost an item will initiate a look out on the app by posting the name of the thing they have lost , the picture of the object or a brief description.
The app will search the data base for the item lost and if such an object is found in the data base then the potential owner will be notifed.
The student then reaches the hub and will be allowed to collect the item after matching the description/photo posted by the user.
The identity of the person collecting the item will be stored in the database.

This solution hasten the process of finding a lost item at the same time it helps the authorites to be more organised and makes it easy for them.
